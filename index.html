            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Masyu is a type of pen and paper puzzle where you draw lines in
            a grid. This webpage features a Masyu solver, as seen above
            and a guide to understanding Masyu below. Be warned that Masyu is
            a simple puzzle type and most of the enjoyment comes from figuring
            out the logic yourself. Reading past this introduction will
            subject you to what could be considered spoilers for
            learning Masyu. To play Masyu you can either search for
            well crafted puzzles set by people or you can go to
            <a href="https://www.kakuro-online.com/masyu">this website</a>,
            set the generator's diffculty to easy and grind away.</p>

            <h4>The goal of this website</h4>

            <h4>Masyu Rules</h4>
            <p>A finished solution will feature a single loop drawn throughout
            the grid. The loop may not branch. The loop must pass through all
            cells with white or black circles. Depending on color, the line
            must pass through the circles subject to some rules. The line may
            not turn in the cell of a white circle, but must turn on either,
            or both sides of the circle. The line must turn in a black circle
            and may not turn on either side of it. A good way to understand
            these rules is to look at examples, and see how the rules apply to
            each circle in the finished solution.</p>

            <h4>How to solve Masyu</h4>
            <p>While it may be nice to think about solving a puzzle by
            starting somewhere and continously extending the line until it
            loops back, Masyu is practically solved by drawing a lot of small
            line segments and slowly connecting them in accordance to the
            rules. Lone circles rarely imply enough constraints to draw any
            line segments, but groups of circles, or circles close the edge
            of the grid often do. A good way to start is looking for circles
            along the edge of the grid. One thing worth mentioning is that
            proper Masyu puzzles must have a unique solution, resulting in both
            some obvious and not so obvious implications.</p>
